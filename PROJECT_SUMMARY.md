# Cipher Yields Exchange - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Cipher Yields Exchange is a next-generation decentralized yield farming platform that combines traditional DeFi functionality with advanced privacy features through Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This project has been completely refactored from its original Lovable-generated state to provide a production-ready, secure, and scalable yield farming solution.

- **Added comprehensive wallet support** for multiple providers

### ✅ Smart Contract Development
- **Created comprehensive FHE-enabled smart contract** (`CipherYieldsExchange.sol`)
- **Implemented yield farming strategies** with encrypted data support
- **Added security features** including ReentrancyGuard and Ownable
- **Integrated OpenZeppelin contracts** for maximum security
- **Designed modular architecture** for easy extension

### ✅ Development Environment
- **Set up Hardhat development environment** for smart contract development
- **Configured deployment scripts** for Sepolia testnet
- **Added comprehensive build system** with TypeScript support
- **Implemented proper dependency management** with package-lock.json

### ✅ Documentation & Deployment
- **Created detailed deployment guide** for Vercel
- **Added comprehensive README** with setup instructions
- **Documented smart contract deployment** process
- **Provided environment configuration** examples
